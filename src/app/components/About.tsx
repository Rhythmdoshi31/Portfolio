        <p className="text-gray-300 text-xl px-4">Hey there! I&apos;m Rhythm Doshi, a web developer who treats code like a creative medium—except my &quot;paintings&quot; involve semicolons, breakpoints, and the occasional 2 AM bug hunt. I believe great software should solve real problems and make users smile (even if it&apos;s just because the form actually submits without crashing).</p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-xl mt-6 mb-16 px-4">As a full-stack developer, I love crafting seamless experiences from database to button click. Fueled by curiosity, coffee, and a healthy dose of stubbornness, I build applications that are  as reliable as they are delightful. Whether its designing sleek UIs or engineering solid backends, I&apos;m all about code that works—and works well.</p>
